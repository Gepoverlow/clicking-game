Gotta Click `em All!

Check the live version out at -> https://gepoverlow.github.io/clicking-game/

The main objective of the game is to capture all first gen pokemons. And how do you catch them? By clicking lots of times!

Each click has a chance of catching the pokemon, depending on its rarity. If you were lucky enough to encounter a Legendary pokemon and your catch rate is too low, maybe it is a good idea to run away from it..... or not, and spam those pokeballs `till you succeed!

As you progress, multiple items will be available to improve your chances, hire an auto catcher or increment the multipliers to your favor. What strategy you choose can affect the speed on how many pokemons you can catch.

As you progress through the game, you can see which you are missing with the handy pokedex down below.

If I had an extra day I would love to work on a backend as a service to display a hiscore table

HAVE FUN !
